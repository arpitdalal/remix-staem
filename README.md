## What did I learn?

- Used [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) for the first time
- Practiced my [Remix](https://github.com/remix-run/remix) skills and learned the way to do things when there is no JavaScript like sorting, searching and implementing infinite scrolling

## Special thanks
